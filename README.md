# RFA_MARKUP
Initial list of keywords that I highlight in an NIH grant RFA. 
At some point I would like to do this in a more clever manner but for now, the fastest is to copy paste the RFA
test into Word, fix the formatting, and then use find-and-replace to bold underline and colorize the words in the list.
Doing this manually still means that different parts of the RFA get read repeatedly which has its own benefits
